## Reset Interval

What is this Button? Well...

The way the downloading Interval works is that a value gets increased by one every hour until the desired hours are reached. This Button will set this value back to 0.

# Upgrade

## Docker

1. `sudo docker-compose down`
2. `git pull`
3. `sudo docker-compose up -d --build`
4. < Remove fragments from old build >

## Manual

1. < stop process >
2. `git pull`
3. < start process >

# Import / Export

I dont know how stable this feature is when there is a huge amount of database entries.

## Export

Get all the Database Tables as a JSON string.

## Import

1.  Go to `/import`
2.  Paste the new Database in (formatted like the output of the Export)

This is ONLY an emergency option in case the database gets messed up / desynced from the file system. This can break A LOT and should only be done with all your brain cells on at least 120% +

## VERY IMPORTANT

I know placing something important this far down is nothing good but thats a you problem, again :D (only if you didnt scroll here)

NO and I mean NOT A SINGLE button has ANY kind of confirmation. So a delete button WILL execute the deleting with NO way back, NO backups NO anything!
